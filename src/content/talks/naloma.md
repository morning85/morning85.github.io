In Natural Language Inference, the accuracy of systems based on compositional semantics depends on the quality of syntactic analysis, which in turn relies on linguistically valid training and evaluation data, typically provided by treebanks. However, conventional treebank evaluation metrics focus on data coverage and fail to assess the linguistic validity of syntactic structures. This paper proposes novel evaluation methods to enable automatic and multi-faceted assessment of linguistic validity. We apply these methods to a Japanese treebank based on Combinatory Categorial Grammar and report the evaluation results.
